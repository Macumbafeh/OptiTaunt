     Brief description

OptiTaunt is an addon for warriors and druids and paladins. It informs you and your party/raid if your taunt/mocking blow/growl/righteous defense was resisted. It works for english and german WoW-clients.
     
	 
	 When will OptiTaunt inform me about resisted taunts?

OptiTaunt detects if your taunt/mocking blow/growl was resisted or the mob was immune. It will inform you if...
- another _player_ actually has aggro of the mob which resisted your taunt/mocking blow/growl

Or, to put it the other way round, it will not inform you if your taunt/mocking blow/growl was resisted and...
- you already have aggro of that mob (who should care about this anyway?)
- you are in pvp and you accidentally tried to taunt another hostile player

     
	 How will OptiTaunt inform me?

There are several options you can enable or disable:
- ErrorFrame, SCT, ..., warnings (via SinkLib)
- Raid- and partychat warnings
- Whisper (automatically whispers a warning to the player which has aggro of the mob which resisted your taunt)
- Audio warnings (plays an audio warning on your client when your taunt resisted, which is quiet valuable in combat situations)


     Ok, ok. Understood. But how do I configure it?

This is simple. OptiTaunt ships with a Fubar-plugin. If you have Fubar installed it will be shown there. If you don't have Fubar installed you will notice a new minimap icon. There are also slash-commands, just type "/ot" for descriptions.
